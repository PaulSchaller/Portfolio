      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/BrandingPhoto.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Paul Schaller">
      <p>I am a web developer.  I enjoy creating websites that serve functions of communicating with, informing, and conducting business with users.  The internet field is growing so rapidly nowadays.  I love that.  I will turn on CNBC and hear the technology news about amazon, facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Apple and be excited that I am part of this field.<br><br>In high school, I was very good in math and scored 35/36 on the math section of my ACT.  Clerical job positions would continually be suggested to me from psychology tests that gauged interests, because I like to organize and file.  Computer programming is a good fit for me.<br><br>My education is a particular strong point.  I have a business school degree, a Master's Degree in computers, and a certificate in web development.  I have completed additional courses in computer programming and computer science.  With my Master's Degree, I graduated with honors.<br><br>I keep current with news and culture.  I have ideas of how a website could be developed to tap into business and communication opportunities with internet users.  I will surf the internet and quickly notice how a website is structured and operating.  I love the mechanics of the web development field.<br><br>I am looking to use my skills, interests, and work experience in a great job opportunity.<br><br>
